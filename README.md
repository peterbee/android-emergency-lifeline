App: “Emergency Lifeline”

The “Emergency Lifeline” app provides a safety measure for people entering potentially dangerous situations.  (E.g, walking several blocks to a car late at night in an unsafe neighborhood.)  The user unlocks the app with a passcode, presses the “SAFE button,” and proceeds to their destination.  If a dangerous situation arises, releasing the “SAFE button” will initiate emergency action.  To disable the app, the user must enter the passcode again within 15 seconds of releasing the “SAFE button.”

This app utilizes the location sensor, uses persistence to store the user’s passcode, and sends and receives information from a server.  The app also uses the camera to take photos (or possibly video) to send to the server.
